# Faster Roboport Charging

A Factorio mod to make the charging speed and the service radius of roboports configurable via the mod settings.

All variables can be changed via the ingame mod settings (needs game relaunch).

## Default Changes to Base Game

* Charging Speed per Robot `1MW` -> `4MW`
* Charging Speed of Roboports internal Battery `5MW` -> `40MW`
* Logistic Radius stays at default `25` Radius (50x50 Tiles)
* Construction Radius stays at default `55` Radius (110x110 Tiles)
